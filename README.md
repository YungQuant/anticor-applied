# An example of the anticor algorithm using pyAlgotrade and python.

The Anticor algorithm for portfolio optimisation, developed by Borodin, El-Yaniv, and Gogan. 
In their original presentation of this algorithm, Borodin et al. provided results on historical markets, demonstrating that the Anticor algorithm not only "beats the market"', but can also beat the best stock.

This is a practicle example of this algorithm in python using pyAlgotrade for backtesting.
