# An example of the anticor algorithm using pyAlgotrade and python.

The Anticor algorithm for portfolio optimisation, developed by Borodin, El-Yaniv, and Gogan. 
In their original presentation of this algorithm, Borodin et al. provided results on historical markets, demonstrating that the Anticor algorithm not only "beats the market"', but can also beat the best stock.

The algorithm code is orignaly developed by T6Labs, this code is a naive example of how this algorithm can be applied using python and pyAlgotrade for backtesting. I encourage anyone who reads this to comment on current implementation, improve it if you want, port it to other languages if you can.

Good luck...
